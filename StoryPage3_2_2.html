                    Shen hurriedly climbs up the stairs as fast as he could.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time he reached the temple, the gates have already been closed and the events had begin.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen is sad and somewhat ashamed of himself.
                    <br><br>
                    He is very eager to learn more about the place and he wanders around.
