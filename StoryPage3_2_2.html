<h1>What a beautiful view</h1>

<p>
Shen is awestruck as he sees the village along with the greenery, beautiful mountains surrounding it, and the river flowing into the sea.
<br><br>
Shen gazed for so long as he had never seen such a beautiful view in his life.
<br><br>
After a long time, Shen was satisfied and realized he way only half way through. If he did not make it in time, the gates would be closed and events would begin.
<br><br>
Shen hurriedly climbs up the stairs as fast as he could.
<br><br>
By the time he reached the temple, the gates have already been closed and the events had begin.
<br><br>
Shen is sad and somewhat ashamed of himself.
<br><br>
He is very eager to learn more about the place and he wanders around.
