<h1>No More!</h1>

<p>
The negative thoughts going through Shen's mind demotivate him.
<br><br>
He believes that poor people like him have no place there and are deemed to be poor just like his parents and grandparents.
<br><br>
Shen is very sad and returns back to his home in tears.
<br><br>
Shen ends up becoming a fisherman just like his father.
