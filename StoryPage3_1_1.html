                    The negative thoughts going through Shen's mind demotivate him.
                    <br><br>
                    He believes that poor people like him have no place there and are deemed to be poor just like his parents and grandparents.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen is very sad and returns back to his home in tears.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen ends up becoming a fisherman just like his father.
