                    As days pass by, routine being followed by Shen becomes really difficult. He has to wake up early, does not get to eat enough and follows rigiours training.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of each day, Shen was getting stronger and stronger.
                    <br><br>
                    For his good performance, Shen was often allowed to meet his family and friends, to whom he would share his experience.
                    <br><br>
                    More than a year passes by and Shen was able to compete with the warriors.
                    <br><br>
                    All of Shen's dedication and determination makes him the protector of the village.
