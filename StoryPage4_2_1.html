                <h2>Run Shen Run!</h2>
                <p>
                    Shen is frightened and runs away from there.
                    <br><br>
                    A student in the temple sees Shen running, uses his skills to pin him down to the ground as he thought Shen might be stealing something but Shen resisted and it required 2 or 3 students to hold down such a young boy.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen is taken back to the old man who looked very calm and asks him why he ran away. Afraid, Shen replies that he had wandered and did not mean to enter the restricted area.
                    <br><br>
                    The old man asks more questions to learn about Shen.
                    <br><br>
                    The old man seemed impressed by so much energy in a young boy to hold off so many students.
