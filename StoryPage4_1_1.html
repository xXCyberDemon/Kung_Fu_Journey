                    Frightened, Shen asks the old man in a quavering voice "Ummm....Where... are the events going on?"
                    <br><br>
                    The old man realizes that the boy is acting like he does not know yet he points him in the direction and replies "Looks like you were late."
                    <br><br>
                    Shen bows his head down in an embarrassed manner.
                    <br><br>
                    The old man asks Shen to take a walk with him and eventually they get into a conversation where Shen is now comfortable to talk to the old man.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long time, Shen shares his love for kung fu. The old man immediately sees in the boy's eyes his determination to learn.
