                    Shen finds himself in a courtyard where many beautiful ancient artefacts were placed.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen quickly gets lost into assessing each one of them as he wanted to learn more about it.
                    <br><br>
                    Just then an old man walks in and approaches Shen.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen is very terrified as he realizes he is in a restricted place and thinks that he would be punished for it.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the old man was calm and kind. He asked Shen how can he help him.
                    <br><br>
                    What shall Shen do?
