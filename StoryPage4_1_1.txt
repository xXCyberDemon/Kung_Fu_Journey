Frightened, Shen asks the old man in a quavering voice "Ummm....Where... are the events going on?"

The old man realizes that the boy is acting like he does not know yet he points him in the direction and replies "Looks like you were late."

Shen bows his head down in embarrassed manner.

The old man asks Shen to take a walk with him and eventually they get into a conversation where Shen is now comfortable to talk to the old man.

After a long time, Shen shares his love for kung fu. The old man immediately sees in the boy's eyes his determination to learn.
