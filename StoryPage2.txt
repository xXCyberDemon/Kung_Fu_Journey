After catching lots of fish, Shen returns back to his home which is a small hut at the shore. Shen gives the caught fish to his parents and heads out to play with his friends.
Shen and his friends usually meet up everyday evening after work to have a chat and play games.

One of the boys inform them of a celebration taking place in the temple of dragon high up in the mountains.
