Shen is awestruck as he sees the village along with the greenery, beautiful mountains surrounding it, and the river flowing into the sea.

Shen gazed for so long as he had never seen such a beautiful view in his life.

After a long time, Shen was satisfied and realized he way only half way through. If he did not make it in time, the gates would be closed and events would begin.

Shen hurriedly climbs up the stairs as fast as he could.

By the time he reached the temple, the gates have already been closed and the events had begin.

Shen is sad and somewhat ashamed of himself.

He is very eager to learn more about the place and he wanders around.
