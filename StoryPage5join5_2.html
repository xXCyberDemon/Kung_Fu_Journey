                    The same thought keeps going on in Shen's mind and he feels embarrassed for doing such a mistake.
                    <br><br>
                    He is now ready to accept the old man's condition however he fears it might have become too late but he would at least give it a try.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen runs back up to the temple where he meets the old man again.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen apologizes for his actions and explains what made him change his mind.
                    <br><br>
                    The old man approves and gives Shen a second chance.
