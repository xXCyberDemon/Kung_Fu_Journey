                    Through the mist of the morning, the enemy troops came with full force towards the small village. The soldiers sent by the king along with the villagers were not able to hold them for long. Accepting defeat the villagers tried to run away, just then Shen and the kung fu masters come to the rescue. Using their skills in kung fu they defeat the large army and bring peace to the village.
