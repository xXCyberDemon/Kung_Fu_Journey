                    With all courage left in him, Shen decides he would go.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen begins his climb.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long time Shen gets tired and decides to take a break.
                    <br><br>
                    Just then, Shen turns back to take a look.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen is awestruck as he sees the village along with the greenery, beautiful mountains surrounding it, and the river flowing into the sea.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen gazed for so long as he had never seen such a beautiful view in his life.
                    <br><br>
                    After a long time, Shen was satisfied and realized he way only half way through. If he did not make it in time, the gates would be closed and events would begin.
