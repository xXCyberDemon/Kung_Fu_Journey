                    Shen gets very emotional as he remembers his mother and returns back home.
                    <br><br>
                    After getting home Shen explains to his mother everything that had happened. To which his mother says that his path ahead will not be easy and he should not get scared of the challenges that come in his way rather he should face them courageously and be determined to reach his end goal.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen listens to the words his mother said and realizes that he had made a mistake.
