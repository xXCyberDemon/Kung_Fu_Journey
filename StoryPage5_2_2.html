                    Shen joins his fellow students for their meal, however he is rejected by them as they thought Shen does not have a place among them as he was from a lower caste family.
                    <br><br>
                    Shen remebers what his mother said and continues to be kind to them. Apart from all this he stays focused towards his goal.
